## Research Details
We demonstrate some Strategies results and Statistical models in this section

### Strategies
We have completed designed the algorithm of **intraday volatile mean reversion strategy**, see `strategyIntraVolMeanRev.py` and run it on *rb1810* object from Oct,2017 to Jul,2018 through on Python [vnpy](https://github.com/vnpy/vnpy).

### Models
Meantime, we have studied various statistical arbitrage model including

1. Fama-French Three Factors Model
2. Hidden Markov Model based on Factors Decomposition
3. 协整性套利
